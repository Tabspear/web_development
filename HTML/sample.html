    <h1> Hi! I am Taofeek </h1>
    <p>....I hope to create a real future for impoverished Africans with technology.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Technology is a venture that is marginally vast and inexhaustible</strong>. Every day there are newer problems, solutions, and fields. Owing to its ever changing nature and increasing demands for skills, the traditional education has been unable to keep up with its pace hence, it employs its hands from every skillful individual willing to learn, including those with limited education and burning desire to learn.
    <br>

    Steps I have take to achieve this objective;
    <ul>
        <li>I have enrolled in Bitwise classes designed to introduce newbies largely without tech background into web development. This will enable me to get familiarized with the subject matter and enhance my skills</li>
        <li>I have identified areas in Tech that humanists can attempt without breaking a sweat, however, anyone can do anything if he sets his heart to it. The tech areas include; Technical writing, sales, design, ideating, Project Managers, Finance, Strategy, Marketing, Sales, HR etc </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    In the future I shall;
    <ul>
        <li> Create solutions that would educate <strong> Africans technology in their local dialects</strong></li>
        <li> <strong>Expand avenues to encourage those without tech background </strong>to become part of ideating and improvement teams in my tech solutions to create new perspectives and classical modernity</li>
         
    </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I am <strong>learning web development at Bitwise Industries in anticipation of getting into their apprenticeship programme</strong>.
        Previously, I have completed a career launchpad(Testify)in software testing and I have manually tested <a href="https://www.cliqki.com/">https://www.cliqki.com/!</a>

        Although, I am from Nigeria, I currently live in <strong>San Francisco, California</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>

        In the past I have worked as a Translator and Instructor of Arabic owing to my first and second degrees in Arabic Studies at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. But with the change of location, I have been better exposed to newer opportunities and experiences that makes transitioning to tech an invaluable course of action.
